MyWorld app is designed to help you effortlessly track your travel experiences by allowing you to keep a detailed record of all the cities you have visited, along with your impressions and memories.

After logging in, you can easily select a city on the map and save it to your travel log. Record your unique experiences and reflections associated with each city you visit.

P.S. To ensure proper functionality of the app, please set up a local server to serve the cities.json file. This can be done by running the following command in your terminal: npm run server/npm install -g json-server/json-server --watch cities.json --port 9000 .The commands will start the server on http://localhost:9000, allowing the app to access and save your travel data seamlessly.
